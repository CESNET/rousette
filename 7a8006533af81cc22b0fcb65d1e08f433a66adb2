      "message": "what about this:\n\n As an extension, this server also supports a special user account whose access is limited to read-only operation to whitelisted modules.\n The reverse proxy should still \"authenticate\" this user and set the respective header, but `rousette` will perform extra safety checks to ensure that there are NACM rules which enforce read-only access.\n Such user must be in group `ANONYMOUS_GROUP` (CMake option) and there must be some specific access right set up in `ietf-netconf-acm` model (these are currently very opinionated for our use-case).\n \n 1. The first entry of `rule-list` list must be configured for `ANONYMOUS_GROUP`.\n 2. All the rules except the last one in this rule-list entry must enable only \"read\" access operation.\n 3. The last rule in the first rule-set must be a wildcard rule that disables all operations over all modules.\n \n The anonymous user access is disabled whenever these rules are not met.",
