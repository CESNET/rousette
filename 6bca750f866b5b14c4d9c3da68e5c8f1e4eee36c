      "message": "I was thinking whether invoking the CB is OK from this context (maybe the client is already gone), but it *is* OK:\n\n- the lock is not needed because the mutex only protects against concurrent modification of the `state`\n- we don\u0027t have to guard against concurrent state change either, because this signal is intended to act as a notification channel to enqueue a RESTCONF-level notification back to the HTTP client which will say \"the subscription is gone\". When that happens, the notification will go through EventStream::activate, and that one is safe regarding the state changes.\n\nThanks for guiding me through this during today\u0027s call.",
