So, please explain here that the lock cannot be held during the onClientDisconnectedCb because...\n\nAlso, please do that in a separate commit, it looks like a fix of https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/rousette/+/8715/5 to me.",

Is there something that needs to be done to filter which parameters are allowed?\n- Please add some tests for this.\n- Later patches in this series implement some filtering, but it looks to me like these parameters are taken from the POSTed data payload, not from the URI parameters.",
