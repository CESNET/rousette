I did not realize that XML vs. JSON encodings use elements from different YANG models (!), and I would appreciate if you could add that as a comment into the code.\n\nAlso, please use some constant for that rather long XML prefix to avoid repetition.\n\nRegarding the style, I was confused a little bit by the fact that this code first creates a child (eventTime) and only then the parent (evenelope); I think that the natural order is the other way round.",
