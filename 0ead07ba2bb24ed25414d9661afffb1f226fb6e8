      "message": "This test (actually, anything around this container) is very hard to read because it relies on the default values. So the test looks as if it was \"just\" setting a leaf, but in fact it\u0027s conflating \"replacing the target node\" with \"side effects of setting something to a default\". As a bonus, after PS24, the description on line 310 no longer matches what\u0027s being tested.",

      "message": "Roughly at this point, my head starts to explode. These tests are complex, and I feel like I have to remember how the DS content looks like after the previous few hundreds of lines. I think it would be healthy to convert this entire test into small SECTIONs. That way, the trivial tests will be super-easy to understand because there\u0027s no previous state to think about, and those tests that are complex will stand out clearly. It\u0027s OK to have a sequence of changes in a test, but please only when it\u0027s really needed (list moves, repeated insertions, etc, are a good candidate).\n\nI\u0027m skipping the rest of these tests because my head is still spinning :).",
