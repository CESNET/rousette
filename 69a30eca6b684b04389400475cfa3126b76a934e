      "message": "Gerrit is a code review system. Until somebody says \"Now this is OK for me, let\u0027s merge\" we iterate changes and only after that a single commit is submitted into the repository, e.g. these versions we iterate will not be seen in the git repo, only the final version.\n\nIn this sentence are referring to a change between version (patchset) 1 and version 2 of this change. When this gets merged the user will not see these versions in his `git log`. He will see a commit with \"all the versions (patchsets) merged into one\" (you can see the diffs here in gerrit under Files tab, select a diff between Base and Patchset n where n is the latest patch). So, this will get very confusing for any user because the content changed a lot between Base and Patchset 2.\n\nIt might be confusing at the start (maybe even a bit more confusing if you are not fluent in git). It took me some time to get used to it as well but I hope you will get a grasp of it.",
