What happens if the path points to an input node of an RPC, for example?\n\nI think that the cleanest fix is to change `asLibyangPath` to accept a \"path type\" argument (i.e., a data node vs. operation node, maybe some other types in future as well), and check the type of each node as the path gets built.",
