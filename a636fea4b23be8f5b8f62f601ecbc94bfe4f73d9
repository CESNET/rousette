      "message": "Huh, this one is interesting -- and I think it deserves a comment. This is about GETing an RPC/action, and the RFC explicitly says that:\n\n\u003e If the target resource of a retrieval request is for an operation\n\u003e resource, then a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" status-line MUST be\n\u003e returned by the server.  The error-tag value\n\u003e \"operation-not-supported\" is used in this case.\n\nBut because the URL path for actually triggering these RPCs/actins uses a different prefix, this should really result in an empty Accepts: header.\n\nCould you please explain this in the commit message, and also add a brief oneliner comment to all places where an empty Allow is tested?",
