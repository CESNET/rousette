      "message": "I\u0027d love to see a test which actually checks that everything is OK in presence of \"hung up\" connections, but I think that this is tricky to implement. Simply closing the connection won\u0027t work (that\u0027s a different scenario after all), so I guess the only possibility would be to pause the execution of the client\u0027s io_service. Could you take a look at that, please?",
