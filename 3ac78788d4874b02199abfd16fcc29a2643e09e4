Here, the test cares about the \"replay-support\" leaf not being there, and maybe also \"replay-log-creation-time\" also being absent. What\u0027s in the rest of the data is not relevant. Also below.\n\nIn short, we have almost 200 lines of code for a test which checks two leafs appearing and disappearing; I think that\u0027s too much noise.",
