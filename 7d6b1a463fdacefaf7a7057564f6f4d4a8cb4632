So, I checked how it\u0027s used in the follow-up patches, and in there it seems that it\u0027s only called with a value that comes from a leaf which is an identityref.\n\nNow, a \"malicious user\" :) might install a YANG module which derives from `ds:datastore` and has some funny value, which will pass subsequent YANG-level validation. But I\u0027ll put my comments to that other patch.",
