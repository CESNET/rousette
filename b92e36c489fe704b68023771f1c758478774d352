      "message": "I was thinking why not use enums for all these HTTP methods in uri.h/cpp, but in the end I think this is a nice design. By using strings, it is not necessary to have this checking for valid HTTP method at two places; just let the URI parser throw about an unexpected/unsupported HTTP method based on the combination of (method, path).\n\nBut in that case I suggest to get rid of this explicit throwing here; just let the URI parser throw an \"appropriate\" exception. I\u0027m OK with a small translator in the catch block, but let\u0027s not add this method whitelist here, please.",
