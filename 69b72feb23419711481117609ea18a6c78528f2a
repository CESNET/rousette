      "message": "Any reason why the error message only mentions the module name, and not the full annotation name? As a client developer, I think I\u0027ll appreciate more an error which tells me that this particular attribute is forbidden, even at the coest that I might decide to send a different attr from the same module which will be also rejected. Let\u0027s not say that \"all of them are forbidden\", let\u0027s point out to a specific one which was used.\n\nAlso, please put the full XPath into errorPath. Then the error message can say just something generic such as \"Meta attribute not allowed\".",
